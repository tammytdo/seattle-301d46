## Feedback

- I do like how the objectives are set up though, even though i feel like i dont have time, i feel like i still do?
- Through debugging I have found a lot of way to become faster at this process.
- Epic Ta's
  - the wonderful help our new TA's have been giving us. from the great detailed feedback on our assignments( making it easy for us to fix what we need to get full credit) to literally just walking around our lab making sure everyone is okay with help.
- towards the end there is a lecture on code review, tomorrows lab and a shred talk
- It would be helpful to have TAs at least until 7pm, after the 2 hour challenge mark.
- quick refresher of 201 concepts before explaining something new in 301.
- The readings are actually difficult to keep up with, difficult to skim
- the reading discussion is not beneficial in 301 like it was in 201
- I miss morning lecture
- More Ginger!
