## Overview
Project: The City Explorer application converts a location entered by the user into a latitude and longitude, then uses those values to request weather information for that location. The latitude and longitude also requests information from APIs from the same search query. 

Problem domain: The weather has a big impact on a person's day. This application informs a person of the weather to help better plan for the day ahead. 

Based on the weather, a person can also what activities they want to do such as movies, meetups, where to eat.
